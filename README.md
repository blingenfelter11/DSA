#What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem we were solving in these projects was how to best store and access data in the progam

#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach this problem we have to understand what data is to be stored and how the data is to be accessed. It is important to understand data structures so that you can assess which data structures will be the quickest and take up the least amount of memory.

#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Thankfully there exists a large online presence for the coding community. When I would run into roadblocks I could usually find good examples to help me better understand the problem.

#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I now have a better understanding of how programs access and display information.

#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I now know what data strucutres are most applicable to specific programs. I can better choose what data strucutre to use to best suit a program while keeping it light and quick.
